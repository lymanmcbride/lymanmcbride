# Welcome to my profile!
Fun fact: [Musicians make great coders](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/composing-code-why-musici_b_10714288). I've studied trombone since I was 11 years old, and attended some of the world's best music schools. I've toured to Europe and Asia as a soloist with various ensembles. I love music! But there's a special excitement that I get from stepping through a project in debug mode and watching all the parts flow together in perfect synchrony. The brain-aching work of puzzling out answers to questions that haven't been solved yet is exciting and consuming. I hope you enjoy my projects, both current and upcoming!
